			<p>While culturally-driven brands need to continually scramble for viable market positions, we believe that institutions that provide both vital services and serve the greater good have an obvious and often overlooked opportunity to truly set themselves apart from their competition. For those institutions, the mission is the message.</p>
			<p>We are a firm focused on marketing communications for those whose mission is to serve. That does not refer to the clich&eacute; of customer service. Rather it points to the seminal human service that is inherent in certain categories &mdash; banking, healthcare, education and insurance. And while our efforts to date have been dedicated to the banking industry, our strategies and sensibilities are easily transferable to companies in other categories to whom mission is equally important.</p>
			<p>In the end, our approach is a simple one: Beginning with the corporate mission, create a communications program that is lived out daily by management and employees and at the same time, enthusiastically accepted by prospects searching out those rare institutions who genuinely have their most deep-seeded interests in mind. While other companies scurry for validity, we help you find and tap the essence that already exits in your brand.</p>
